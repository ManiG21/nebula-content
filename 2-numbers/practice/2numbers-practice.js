// Declare a variable and assign it to a numeric value
// Double that value and re-assign it to the previous variable
let x =7
// Check it worked by logging to the console
 x *= 2
 //x = x * 2
// Create two numbers, assign them to variables and add them together
const y = 4
const z = 40

// Check it worked by logging to the console 

// Create three numbers, assign them to variables and subtract the smaller two from the largest
// Check it worked by logging to the console
const a = 15

// Create two even numbers, assign them to variables and divide one from the other
// // Check it worked by logging to the console
const even1 = 8
const even2 = 10
const answer1 = even1 / even2
console.log(answer1)
// Create two odd numbers, assign them to variables and multiply one from the other
const odd1 = 11

// Create a variable and log it's remainder, if divided by 3, to the console 
const pr = 25

// Answer in plain text, what is modulo especially useful for?
10 % 2 // if remainder is 0, number is even
13 % 2 // if the remainder is 1, number is odd
