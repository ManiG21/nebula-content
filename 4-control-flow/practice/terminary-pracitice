// USE FAKE INFO FOR THE FOLLOWING EXERCISE

// Initialize a variable called CreditCardNum, set it equal to a fake credit card string-number
const CreditCardNum = 635477778888
// Initialize a variable called last4SS, set it equal to a 4 string-numbers (dont use your real SS last 4!)
const last4SS = "2321"
// Initialize a variable called userId, set it equal to a fake user ID

const userId = 222613
// Initialize a variable called password, set it equal to a fake password

const password = "Pizza"

// Create two last variables called inputId & inputPass, initially set them as the same values as userId and password

const inputId =  222613

const inputPass = "Pizza"


// Write a ternary statement that checks if userId is equal to inputId and if password is also equal to inputPass

let result = userId + password === inputId + inputPass ? "Those are correct" : "inputs are in valid"
// If they are the same, log the credit card num and the last4SS
console.log(result)
// If not, log 'incorrect username or id'
